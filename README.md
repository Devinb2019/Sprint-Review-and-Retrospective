# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I first begin by communicating with end users and gathering a deep understanding of their needs. Putting myself in their shoes also aids in interpreting user needs. User stories help in this situation by collaborating to find what needs to be prioritized first and foremost. They allow us to understnad their goals, challenges and expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing software through a few steps. These steps include iterative development, continuous feedback from stakeholders or users, and leaning on adaptability. The agile process that I see myself using most in future development is Scrum with it's ease of organization, planned sprints and managing tasks as a team. Retrospectives following the end of a development is also an incredibly useful tool.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means adhering to multiple different traits and expectations. These include consistent communication with active listening, collaboration as a team player and being open to feedback, technical skills of being adaptive to the continuously changing industry, and adaptability to be flexible and problem solving on the go. Combining a healthy amount all of these traits will insure that you are a good team member in software development.
